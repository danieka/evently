# Business model

## What's a business model doing in an open source project?
I've long wanted to use the advice "The Startup Owner's Manual" in a practical way. So I've tried using it when sketching out Evently to make sure that I address an actual problem that users have and that I'm solving it the right way. I don't actually intend to make any money, beyond what's required to keep the lights on, if even that is possible.

## Vision

This is my personal vision.

- Wan't to make it simple for me to invite friends without giving up my data
- Users without Facebook shouldn't be excluded from social activities
- Events should be organised without putting any demand on the user having accounts on certain platforms
- Should be easy to use
- Should not be ad-financed
- Should tie into the existing ecosystem of open source social networks

## Product features and benefits

Biggest pain is having to use Facebook for organising events. Users want to get free from Facebook but are prevented by the lock-in of that ecosystem. Users who have left Facebook are excluded from activities. Everyone's need is shoehorned into the same mold. You have no ability to use another client. No means to sync to your calendar. No way to choose how your data is used.

### Benefits:
- No signup required for neither event coordinator nor participants
- No advertisment
- Privacy guaranteed, needs explaining
- Easy to use, does one thing and does it well


### MVP

Allows the user to create events and for participants to RSVP.

Things to validate:
- Do users feel a need to replace Facebook?
- Is the given feature set enough to appeal to users?
- Are the following features useful?
    - Map integration
    - Images
    - Comments
    - Reminders
    - Calendar sync
